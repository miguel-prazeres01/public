Points are awarded according to the percentage of test cases that you passed.
In this breakdown the percentages and points are rounded to the nearest 2 decimals.
The final grade for the assignment is computed without intermediate rounding.

For each exercise we provide a further breakdown into sections to indicate where you may have a made a mistake.
For each section which was not completely correct we provide one specific case that failed.
