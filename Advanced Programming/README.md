# Advanced Programming
This course focused on using non-trivial concepts such as:
 - Introspection
 - Intercession
 - Meta-programming
 - Macros
 - Multiple dispatch
 - Multiple combination
 - Multiple inheritance
 - Mixins
 - Lazy evaluation
 - Meta-circular evaluators

The main project was wrote in Julia, and the objective was to develop a Meta-Object Protocol, expanding the Julia Programming Language, following the main principles of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).
