# Conversational Agents

This course was taken at TU Delft and focused on the linguistic and psychological theory to conversational agent systems.

The project consisted in implementing a proper conversational agent using Furhat to carry out a user-study. Our agent was a personal sleep recommendation agent, and the objective was to assess if the long-term memory had impact on the behavior and decisions taken by the subject.
