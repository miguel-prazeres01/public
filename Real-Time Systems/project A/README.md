# Real-time Systems Lab - Assignment A: Coding Schedulers

In this assignment, you will be implementing and testing several schedulers for a real-time system on actual hardware (STM32F4DISCOVERY).
The hardware runs [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/), which is a lightweight open-source real-time operating system (RTOS),
used throughout industrial applications.  You will implement a rate-monotonic (RM) and 
earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduler. The resulting schedules must then be plotted and analyzed by using a logic analyzer. 

> If you have not installed Zephyr and verified the setup yet, go through the lab setup [here](https://cese.pages.ewi.tudelft.nl/real-time-systems/lab_setup.html).
